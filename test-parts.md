## Part 1
This part of the exercise is to watch the candidate see an error message and understand how they approach the problem.

- Do they see the errors in the application?
- Did they intuitively look at console to see error?
- Were they able to read and understand call stacks?
- If they solved the button issue, did they see the assignment issue?
---
## Part 2
This part of the exercise is to watch the candidate investigate problems that don't show errors.

- Did they navigate the component tree logically to find the problem service?
- Were they able to read confusing code and understand how it works?
- If they don't know exact cookie logic (COMPLETELY OK!!), do they know what resources to look at (MDN, W3Schools)?
> **Nice to have:** Does the candidate already know cookie syntax or can read MDN and understand immediately?
---
## Part 3
This part of the exercise is to watch the candidate develop a new feature.
- Has the candidate begun to understand the codebase?
- Did the candidate write clean code?
- Was the candidate able to build the feature and talk out his methodology?
--- 
## Part 4
This part of the exercise is to watch the candidate investigate problems and find solutions.
- How does the candidate view issues with the application? Do they view everything as ok?
- Does the candidate find issues and come up with ways to fix them?

If they are struggling with issues to solve, suggest the issues below.\
*Do not expect the candidate to find these specific problems*

1. Remember Assignments
   - It seems like you are getting new assignments each time the user comes back to your page.
     - Does the candidate see the difference each time he refreshes?
   - How can we remember what assignment the user got the last time
     - We have been talking cookies, is the candidate confident to implement a new cookie?
     - Does the candidate remember to respect the consent decision?
2. The blip
   - We know that first time users won't have an assignment so we will need to wait for the API to return the assignment.
   - For returning users, we think we can give them a better solution. Do you have any ideas?

## Part 5
- Alike part 4, how does the candidate see problems?
- Is the candidate afraid of bringing up issues?
> **Nice to have:** Does the candidate see any SSR or SEO issues?
